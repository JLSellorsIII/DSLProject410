Error with cloning, had to use direct file upload, apoligies to my teammates who aren't being credited properly, will attempt to remedy in future.
I implemented the entirety of Tokenization and Parsing, as well as the Lights and Loops for the Simulation as well as the closure and opening of lanes.
Validation Primarily implemented by Eric
Majority of Simulation implemented by Avi and Yuki.
